# Benchmarks of ARM Linux inside Parallels

## Motivation
I was going to use parallels to use a linux on my MacBook Pro. The device is owned by my employer which includes several Mobile Device Management (MDM) profiles. This is why I did not want to use the host system for private stuff, but instead run everything inside a linux. The distribution itself is not of matter, my focus was solely on performance. This is why I tested multiple distributions to find out, if there even is a noticable difference nowadays. To make sure others could profit as well, I wanted to make the results public.
If you have any recommendations for future tests, let me know by opening up an issue.

## Benchmarks
For the benchmarks I used [Phoronix Test Suite (Github)](https://github.com/phoronix-test-suite/phoronix-test-suite/). The tests that were executed are all readily available in the testsuite [Workstation of OpenBenchmarking.org](https://openbenchmarking.org/suite/pts/workstation).

**Hardware**
MacBook Pro 14" (M3 Pro), 36GB Memory

**Software**
* MacOS: 14.3.1
* Parallels 19.3.0 (54924)

* Fedora Linux 39 (Workstation Edition)
* Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)
* Arch Linux ARM

## Results
